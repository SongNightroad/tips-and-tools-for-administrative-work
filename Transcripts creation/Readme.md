**BAS file of my second VBA-project.**

As in my previous project, I got an excel-file with grades, and I have to make transcripts for all the students. I tried to consider my previous experience and automate some processes.

Firstly, I did a small thing:
 - a little bookmark-naming script   
It takes names of all subject bookmarks and adds `_credits`, `_mode`, `_Academic_results`, `_Grades` to them. It makes it easier for me to add then these bookmarks to the .docx file and removes the need to copy and change manually.

The second thing I did:
 - a little script for subject code  
It takes the same names of all subject bookmarks and prints me a vba-code for adding the grade of the subject in the student's template. It's a crutch, I know, and it doesn't check the column name, but it is a tiny bit of automatization I want.


So on, I have a several new ideas for my next project.
