**BAS file of my first VBA-project.**

I took data of students enrolled in 2017, I got one excel-table for all students and all their final grades. I needed to create transcripts for them. So I have made a lot of bookmarks in the template .docx document and then I inserted grades to bookmarks of each subject separately. I create a sub-function for this operation, and then called it manually for each subject. I think I should improve it later.  
So on, all bookmarks are created by one pattern, except one subject (it looks different). The workpiece can be used the next time.
